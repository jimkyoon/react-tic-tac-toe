Welcome to my React.js Tic Tac Toe game!

Built this following the original React.js tutorial guide on how to build a tic tac toe game.

This tic tac toe game includes a playing board, clickable squares, swapping players each turn, and history of moves!

Added my notes along the way to help me understand what is going on and progress.

May update this game to include things like highlighting winning move, reset, stating who won, etc.
